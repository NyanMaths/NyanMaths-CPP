# NyanMaths-CPP
NyanMaths is a C++ maths-oriented library which wants to complete the STL.
I will soonly (I hope) write a proper documentation but the library is small enough to self-document.


# Main functionalities in version 0 :

Quite many geometrical shapes (cubes, polygons...), besides polymorphic.

A beginning for a cooler functions API (like poylynomials or linear functions)

Unit conversion tools for measurements and masses.

Some useless (I guess ?) algorithms.
